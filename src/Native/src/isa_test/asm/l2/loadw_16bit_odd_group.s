# 16 bit weights with a group of 3 bytes: the elements are split between two rows
# l2_load_w_conf: rlen_decompressed = number of weight elements (the high half of the 64 bit wconf), l2_datatype, ddr_datatype (element
# size code 0: 1 byte, 1: 2 bytes, 2: 4 bytes, 3: packed 4 bit, 4: packed 6 bit), enable_decompress.
# l2_load_w copies the weights to the GLB in groups of rvalid_c_num + 1 BYTES (of the GLB data, whatever the element size), every group
# starts a new row of 24 bytes; with 16 bit weights an odd group size splits an element between two rows.
